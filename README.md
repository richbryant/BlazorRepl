# BlazorRepl
Experimental.  A C# REPL in Blazor.

Unlike some versions, this doesn't rely on JavaScript at all and runs entirely in the browser.

You'll notice a small startup delay - need to download the Roslyn compiler - and also it's not exactly snappy in operation, again because hey!  You're running the whole C# compiler in a browser!

Feel free to use and abuse as you see fit.
